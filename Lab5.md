I am pretty sure that I wrote my script correctly, however it seems to be something wrong with the tests themselves?
Here are the tests for DocSearch in the TestDocSearch class:

TA Response:
Hello! Thank you for sharing the details of the bug you are encountering. It looks as if the java file you have downloaded is actually a linux file.
The issue stems from where you are running your tests. 
A question to think about: What are the differences in how to write paths between Linux and Windows?
