  This did not work for me, I got it to work in lab and it seemed like it worked here but then it prompted me for a password again.

  **Something I learned in Week 2/3 that I didn't know before**
  * I learned a lot about paths and how to navigate different commands.
  * I also learned how to use commands to double check that I am in the right place.
  * I also learned how to login to a remote terminal and copy files from one to another.
